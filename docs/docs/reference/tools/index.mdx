This section provides reference documentation for Agent Forge's tool system, which allows agents to interact with their environment and perform specialized tasks.

At the core of this system is the abstract [`Tool`](./tool.mdx) class, which you'll extend to create custom tools. 

Key concepts and components in this section include:

*   **[`Tool` Base Class](./tool.mdx):** Understanding the structure of a tool, its parameters, and how to implement the `run` method.
*   **`ToolParameter` Interface:** Defining the inputs your tool accepts (covered within the [`Tool`](./tool.mdx) page and will be detailed further in the `Types` reference).
*   **[`ToolRegistry`](./tool-registry.mdx):** Managing collections of tools, used internally by `AgentForge` but can also be used independently.
*   **Built-in Tools:** Documentation for pre-packaged tools provided by Agent Forge:
    *   [`WebSearchTool`](./web-search-tool.mdx)
    *   [`WebPageContentTool`](./web-page-content-tool.mdx)
*   **MCP Tools:** Information on how tools provided via the Model Context Protocol are represented (e.g., [`MCPTool`](./mcp-tool.mdx)).

Refer to the specific pages for detailed API information on each component.
